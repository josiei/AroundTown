## How to Setup 

    1. Fork this repository. 
    
    2. Open up terminal on your machine. 
    
    3. In terminal, git clone this repository: 
        ```git clone https://github.com/josiei/AroundTown.git```
        
    4. In terminal, cd into the repository and open it:

        ```
    5. Once the project is open, press the play button in the top left corner. 
    
    Note: This project does not use a package manager like Cocoapods, but you may 
    need to add the WebKit framework to `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content`
    in the General settings depending on your version of Xcode. 

## Decisions and Tradeoffs

    ### MVC Pattern
    
    ### Using delegate pattern for venueTable in ViewController 
    
    ### Passing data through using a property for DetailViewController and WebViewController
    
    ### Encapsulating MapView and Venue Cell
    
    ### Using Notification center for detecting change in user's location
    
    ### Using a combination of AutoLayout and Stacks Views to layout UI programmatically
